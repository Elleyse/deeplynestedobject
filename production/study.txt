Deeply Nested Object
The object I am going to track is how many times I am angry in class.
Having ADHD I feel like this is a common trend with my classmates who
also have ADHD along with the fact that half the time I am mad because 
of my ADHD symptoms. 

In a study published on U.S. National Library of Medicine they tracked:
"How do ADHD Children perceive their cognitive, affective, and behavioral
aspects of anger expression in school settling?"

Their conclusion was:
Children with ADHD do not report higher rates of experience of anger and 
they do not apply destructive strategies more than the control group. However,
children with ADHD appear to have a more hostile outlook toward school and their
coping strategy is weaker than that of the control group. 

What I find most interesting about this study is that the ADHD children do not have
good coping strategies for their anger in class. I think if I track when I am
mad in class I can try and see what made me mad in the first place and then 
maybe I can come up with some coping mechanisms.

things I want to track:
- what class I am in
- what time I am feeling angry 
- who is talking in my class when I am angry
- how much have I eaten 
- do I understand what's going on?
